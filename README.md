## 3. Uniqueness
### TF-IDF for Machine Learning (Our search efficiency solution)
In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Tf–idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today; 83% of text-based recommender systems in digital libraries use tf–idf.

### Algorithm for automatically select seats

Who wouldn't want to get the best seats available automatically while ordering movie tickets.
The algorithm we created automatically selects the best seats for viewing a movie depending on the type of tickets and number of tickets selected.
The algorithm calculates for each seat the horizontal and vertical viewing angle of the viewer by distance from the screen.
Using a calculation that we created between the viewing angles and the data we collected regarding viewing and seating recommendations,    we created a complete mapping of the entire hall.
The user will always be able to get the optimal seat available.
